Large feature request. I want to do a wordle style daily challenge it should
be titled 'If you can name the artist, you win 5 "bucks"' (thats the catch
phrase of the show), after each round the user should be prompted with a "Double
 or nothing?" where users can be prompted to either cash out their points, or
risk losing it all. each day there will be a single, global game each day,
updating at midnight in your local timezone. the daily game will be
pre-generated special packs (not shown in the normal list), these packs will
have a set order, where the tracks get progressively harder. (e.g. 5 easy, 5
medium, 5 hard, 5 legendary).
